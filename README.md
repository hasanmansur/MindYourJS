# MindYourJS

This a collection of simple code snippets regarding some basic concepts of Javascript. Some days ago I started to study from http://javascriptissexy.com/ & I felt the urgence of making these code snippets so that I(or someone else interested) may look into it time to time.

Topics covered are as follows:
* Objects
* Prototype
* Scope
* Hoisting
* Closure
* Callback

Repo name "mindYourJS" is inspired from [Mind Your Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdfukpp_jfM&list=PLi0SGyv1KPsdo8PgKoZWggcLofncM-DQK), a famous  British comedy television series.
