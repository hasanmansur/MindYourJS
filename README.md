# mindYourJS

This a collection of simple code snippets regarding some basic yet crucial concepts of Javascript. Some days ago I started to study from http://javascriptissexy.com/ & eventually I felt the urgence of making this simple code base which one might look into time to time.

Topics covered are as follows:
1. Objects
2. Prototype
3. Scope
4. Hoisting
5. Closure
6. Callback

Happy coding!
